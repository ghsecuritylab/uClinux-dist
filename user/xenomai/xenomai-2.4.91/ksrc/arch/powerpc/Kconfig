	The FPU executes instructions from the processor's normal
	instruction stream. It can handle the types of high-precision
	floating-point processing operations commonly found in
	scientific, engineering, and business applications.
	If your target system has no FPU, say NO here; otherwise,
	enabling FPU support when the hardware is available may
	greatly improve	performance.

config XENO_HW_UNLOCKED_SWITCH
	bool "Enable unlocked context switch"
	depends on IPIPE_UNMASKED_CONTEXT_SWITCH
	default y
	help

	The nucleus may allow non-atomic execution of the
	machine-dependent context switching code, so that other CPUs
	and/or local interrupts may execute concurrently.

	This option reduces interrupt latency when costly cache and
	TLB flushes are required to switch context, and may improve
	concurrency on some SMP/multi-core systems as well.
