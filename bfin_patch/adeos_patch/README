The adeos Blackfin specific code has been merged to svn trunk linux kernel. This patch contains adeos -noarch code from Philippe:

"
To start this cycle, I have attached a major update to the I-pipe Blackfin port
as available from your GIT tree as of today (commit
#38a13eddc0a76bc73ebb2fe9e73361df5d0c35ff). Tested on bf537 and bf561
successfully. In the same move, I have prepared the Xenomai -stable and -devel
branches to support 2.6.28, against which these patches apply.
"
